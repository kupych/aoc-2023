# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

How to use: 

1. Copy your input files into the `files` folder, using the day as the name (e.g.: `files/1` would be the location of your Day 1 input)
2. Run `iex -S mix` in the root folder.
3. To run the solutions for a given day, use the following syntax: 
`Aoc.Day.solve(Aoc.DayX)` where `X` is the day you'd like to solve.
